# Databricks Watchdog

**The platform enforces governance. Nobody measures it.**

ABAC masks columns. Tag policies reject bad values. DQ monitors flag anomalies. But ask your CDO: *"across all our policies — security, data quality, cost, AI agents — how compliant are we right now?"* Nobody can answer that.

Watchdog is the compliance posture layer for Unity Catalog. It crawls your estate, classifies resources through an ontology, evaluates declarative policies across every governance domain, tracks violations with owner accountability, and gives you a single compliance percentage that goes up or down over time.

---

## Why Watchdog Exists

### The question nobody can answer today

Your CDO asks: *"Across all our data — every table, every grant, every agent — how compliant are we right now? Who owns the gaps? Is it getting better or worse?"*

Today, the answer requires manually stitching together:
- **Tag Policies** — "are the right tags applied?" (Governance Hub)
- **ABAC rules** — "are columns masked?" (information_schema)
- **DQ Monitors** — "are quality checks running?" (Lakehouse Monitoring)
- **Grants** — "are permissions group-based?" (information_schema)
- **AI agents** — "are they governed? who's accessing PII?" (system.serving)

Each of these lives in a different UI, different system table, different team's responsibility. There is no single view across all of them. There is no concept of "this resource violates 3 policies across 2 governance domains." There is no owner accountability. There is no trend line.

### What the platform does vs. what's missing

The platform **enforces** governance at runtime — ABAC masks a column, a tag policy rejects an invalid value, a row filter hides rows. This is the immune system. It works.

But enforcement is not posture. Nobody measures:

| Question | Platform answer |
|---|---|
| What % of PII tables have a data steward? | **Can't answer** — requires cross-tag evaluation |
| Which owners have the most open violations? | **Can't answer** — no violation tracking per owner |
| Are we more compliant this month than last? | **Can't answer** — no trend data |
| If I add a "PII must have retention" policy, how many tables fail? | **Can't answer** — no simulation |
| Which AI agents are accessing sensitive data without governance metadata? | **Can't answer** — no agent compliance layer |
| One policy change should cascade to PII, HIPAA, and SOX assets — does it? | **Can't answer** — flat tags have no inheritance |

### What Watchdog adds

Watchdog is the **compliance posture layer** that sits on top of the platform's enforcement:

- **Cross-domain evaluation**: one scan measures security, data quality, cost, operations, and agent governance together
- **Composable rules**: `IF pii THEN must have steward AND retention` — logic the platform can't express
- **Ontology with inheritance**: one policy on `ConfidentialAsset` covers PII, HIPAA, SOX, and every child class
- **Violation lifecycle**: open → resolved → exception, with deduplication, first-detected dates, and trend tracking
- **Owner accountability**: every violation attributed to a person with remediation steps
- **AI agent governance**: crawls agents and execution traces, classifies managed vs customer endpoints, evaluates agent-specific policies, produces prioritized remediation
- **AI interface**: 13 MCP tools so Claude, Genie, and AI agents can query and act on governance posture
- **Compliance trends**: scan-over-scan deltas, direction indicators, rolling averages

### The analogy

The platform is the **immune system** — it blocks bad things at runtime.

Watchdog is the **annual physical** — it measures overall health, tracks trends, and tells you what to fix before symptoms appear.

For AI agents, Watchdog is also the **safety briefing** — it checks governance before agents access data and produces compliance reports after they finish.

## What You Get in 30 Minutes

Deploy Watchdog to a workspace and run one scan. Here's what comes back:

### Cross-Domain Compliance Posture

One view across security, data quality, cost, and operations:

| Domain | Resources | Critical | High | Medium |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SecurityGovernance | 2,352 | 8 | 4,480 | 10 |
| CostGovernance | 2,374 | 0 | 40 | 2,431 |
| DataQuality | 2,134 | 0 | 3 | 3,492 |
| OperationalGovernance | 22 | 0 | 0 | 22 |

*The Governance Hub shows tag policies, ABAC rules, and DQ monitors separately. Nobody aggregates across all of them.*

### Owner Accountability

Every violation is attributed to a resource owner with remediation steps:

| Owner | Total | Critical | High | Policies Violated | Domains |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| stuart.gano@ | 358 | 1 | 96 | 20 | 4 |
| System user | 896 | 0 | 296 | 7 | 3 |
| eric.popowich@ | 870 | 0 | 268 | 7 | 3 |

*The platform has no concept of "violations per owner" or accountability tracking.*

### Ontology Classification with Inheritance

Resources are classified into a hierarchy. One policy on `ConfidentialAsset` automatically covers every `PiiAsset`, `HipaaAsset`, and `SoxAsset`:

```
PiiTable → PiiAsset → ConfidentialAsset → DataAsset
```

*UC has flat tags. Change a policy at the ConfidentialAsset level? With tags, you'd edit every child policy individually.*

### Actionable Remediation Lists

Watchdog caught 211 direct-user grants (POL-A002):

```
3f550a6e-...  has USE_SCHEMA  on schema  explain_my_bill
account users has SELECT      on table   property_listing_sample
```

An admin takes this list and migrates every grant to group-based access. The platform shows grants in `information_schema` but doesn't flag which ones violate your policies.

### Composable Rules the Platform Can't Express

| Rule | What It Checks | Platform Equivalent |
|---|---|---|
| IF `data_classification = pii` THEN must have BOTH `data_steward` AND `retention_days` | Cross-tag conditional | **None** |
| Grant grantee must match regex `^(group:\|account group:)` | Grant metadata evaluation | **None** |
| IF `environment = prod` THEN must have `on_call_team` AND `alert_channel` | Conditional tag requirement | **None** |

Tag Policies enforce "this tag must use these values." Watchdog rules express arbitrary logic across tags and metadata.

### AI Agent Runtime Governance

Watchdog crawls deployed AI agents (Apps + serving endpoints) and their execution traces from `system.serving.endpoint_usage`. Real results from fe-stable:

| What | Count |
|---|---|
| Agents discovered | 38 (5 Databricks Apps + 33 serving endpoints) |
| Agent execution traces | 500 (per-requester usage from last 7 days) |
| Ungoverned agents | 533 (no owner metadata → POL-AGENT-002 violation) |
| Top requester | 8.9M requests, 31B input tokens (flagged as high-volume) |

```
Agent starts task
  → check_before_access("my-agent", "catalog.schema.pii_table")
  ← DENY: "Table is PII (PhiAsset), agent has no audit logging.
           Suggest: catalog.schema.pii_table_masked"
  → check_before_access("my-agent", "catalog.schema.public_table")
  ← ALLOW: "No violations, DataAsset classification"
  → log_agent_action("my-agent", "data_access", "catalog.schema.public_table")
  ... agent does work ...
  → report_agent_execution("my-agent", "Generated sales report")
  ← {compliance_status: "needs_review", risk_level: "medium",
     checks: {passed: 1, denied: 1, warned: 0}}
```

*The platform has no concept of AI agent governance. MLflow traces what agents did. Watchdog evaluates whether what they did complied with your policies.*

**Delta tables are the contract.** Every consumer reads the same tables. No APIs between layers.

## Quickstart (30 minutes)

### Prerequisites

- Databricks workspace with **Unity Catalog** enabled
- **Databricks CLI** v0.230+ (`databricks --version`)
- A catalog where Watchdog can create a `watchdog` schema
- A SQL warehouse (Starter Warehouse works)

### Step 1: Clone and configure

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stuagano/databricks-watchdog.git
cd databricks-watchdog
```

Edit `engine/databricks.yml` — add a target for your workspace:

```yaml
targets:
  my-workspace:
    mode: development
    default: true
    workspace:
      host: https://your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com
      profile: your-profile
    variables:
      catalog: your_catalog
      schema: watchdog
```

### Step 2: Deploy the engine

```bash
cd engine
databricks bundle validate -t my-workspace
databricks bundle deploy -t my-workspace
```

### Step 3: Run your first scan

```bash
databricks bundle run watchdog_adhoc_scan -t my-workspace
```

This crawls all resources (tables, volumes, jobs, clusters, warehouses, grants, service principals, agents, agent execution traces), classifies them via the ontology (28 classes), evaluates 46 policies, and writes violations. Takes 2-3 minutes.

### Step 4: Check results

```sql
-- How many violations?
SELECT severity, COUNT(*) FROM your_catalog.watchdog.violations
WHERE status = 'open' GROUP BY severity;

-- Who owns the most?
SELECT owner, COUNT(*) as violations
FROM your_catalog.watchdog.violations
WHERE status = 'open' GROUP BY owner ORDER BY violations DESC LIMIT 10;

-- What's the compliance posture by domain?
SELECT * FROM your_catalog.watchdog.v_domain_compliance;
```

### Step 5: Run the demo notebook (recommended)

Import `engine/notebooks/governance_posture_demo.py` into your workspace. It walks through:

1. **What the Governance Hub shows** — UC asset inventory, tag coverage, privilege distribution (system tables)
2. **Where the gaps are** — cross-domain posture, cross-tag rules, violation tracking, owner accountability
3. **What Watchdog adds** — compliance posture by domain, ontology classification, owner violation detail, composable rules, remediation lists
4. **The unified view** — cross-join queries that combine Hub system tables with Watchdog data (who has access to violated resources, untagged tables with violations)

This is the best way to demonstrate the value to a customer or stakeholder.

### Step 6: Deploy the Lakeview dashboards (optional)

```bash
python engine/dashboards/lakeview/deploy_dashboard.py \
  --profile your-profile \
  --catalog your_catalog \
  --schema watchdog \
  --warehouse-id your_warehouse_id \
  --publish
```

Two dashboards available:
- **Watchdog Governance Posture** — standalone Watchdog compliance data (5 pages)
- **UC Governance Hub + Watchdog** — unified dashboard combining UC system tables with Watchdog compliance. Includes cross-join views: who has access to violated resources, untagged tables with violations.

### Step 7: Deploy the MCP server (optional)

Edit `mcp/databricks.yml` with your workspace target, then:

```bash
cd mcp
databricks bundle deploy -t my-workspace
databricks apps start watchdog-mcp-my-workspace --profile your-profile
# Wait for compute to be ACTIVE, then:
databricks apps deploy watchdog-mcp-my-workspace \
  --source-code-path /Workspace/Users/you@company.com/.bundle/watchdog-mcp/my-workspace/files \
  --profile your-profile
```

Connect from Claude Code: `https://<app-url>/mcp/sse`

### Step 8: Deploy the Genie Space (optional)

```bash
python mcp/genie/deploy_genie_space.py \
  --catalog your_catalog \
  --schema watchdog \
  --warehouse-id your_warehouse_id \
  --profile your-profile
```

Business users can ask: "Who has the most critical violations?" or "Which PII tables lack a data steward?"

### Step 9: Deploy AI guardrails (optional)

Edit `guardrails/databricks.yml` with your workspace target, then:

```bash
cd guardrails
databricks bundle deploy -t my-workspace
databricks apps start mcp-ai-guardrails-my-workspace --profile your-profile
# Wait for ACTIVE, then deploy code (same pattern as MCP server)
```

AI agents get build-time AND runtime governance:
- **Build-time**: "Is this table safe to use in my agent?" (`validate_table_usage`, `build_safely`)
- **Runtime**: "Check this table before I access it" (`check_before_access` — returns allow/deny/warn with reasons)
- **Audit**: "Log what my agent did" (`log_agent_action` — structured compliance audit trail)
- **Post-execution**: "How did my agent do?" (`report_agent_execution` — compliance report with risk level)

## Customization

### Adding ontology classes

```yaml
# engine/ontologies/resource_classes.yml
derived_classes:
  HipaaAsset:
    parent: ConfidentialAsset
    description: "Subject to HIPAA regulations"
    classifier:
      tag_equals:
        regulatory_domain: "HIPAA"
```

Classifiers: `tag_equals`, `tag_in`, `tag_exists`, `tag_matches`, `metadata_equals`, `metadata_matches`, `all_of`, `any_of`, `none_of`.

### Writing policies

```yaml
# engine/policies/my_policies.yml
policies:
  - id: POL-CUSTOM-001
    name: "PII must have a data steward"
    applies_to: PiiAsset
    domain: SecurityGovernance
    severity: critical
    description: "Every PII asset needs a named steward"
    remediation: "Add a 'data_steward' tag"
    active: true
    rule:
      ref: has_data_steward
```

Rules support: `tag_exists`, `tag_equals`, `tag_in`, `metadata_equals`, `all_of`, `any_of`, `none_of`, `if_then`, `metadata_gte`, and references to named primitives.

### Multi-metastore scanning

Set `WATCHDOG_METASTORE_IDS=ms-123,ms-456` and use the `crawl_all_metastores` entrypoint. All results go to the same tables with a `metastore_id` discriminator.
